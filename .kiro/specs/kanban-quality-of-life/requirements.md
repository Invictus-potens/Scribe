# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Kanban board functionality with quality of life improvements that make the boards more user-friendly and responsive. The improvements focus on column management capabilities, responsive design based on content, and better user interaction patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Kanban board user, I want to edit column titles directly, so that I can quickly rename columns without complex workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a column title THEN the system SHALL display an inline edit field
2. WHEN a user presses Enter or clicks outside the edit field THEN the system SHALL save the new column title
3. WHEN a user presses Escape while editing THEN the system SHALL cancel the edit and restore the original title
4. IF the user has manage_columns permission THEN the system SHALL allow column title editing
5. IF the user lacks manage_columns permission THEN the system SHALL NOT display edit functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Kanban board manager, I want to delete columns that are no longer needed, so that I can keep my board organized and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with manage_columns permission hovers over a column header THEN the system SHALL display a delete button
2. WHEN a user clicks the delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN a user confirms deletion AND the column is empty THEN the system SHALL delete the column immediately
4. WHEN a user confirms deletion AND the column contains cards THEN the system SHALL prompt for card relocation or deletion
5. WHEN a column is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the order_index of remaining columns
6. IF a column contains cards and no relocation target is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Kanban board user, I want columns to automatically adjust their width based on content, so that I can see more information without horizontal scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a column has few cards THEN the system SHALL use a minimum width for optimal space usage
2. WHEN a column has many cards THEN the system SHALL expand the column width up to a maximum limit
3. WHEN the total board width exceeds viewport THEN the system SHALL enable horizontal scrolling
4. WHEN cards have long titles or descriptions THEN the system SHALL adjust column width to accommodate content
5. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate column widths responsively

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile Kanban user, I want the board to work well on smaller screens, so that I can manage my tasks on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL stack columns vertically or enable smooth horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL show 2-3 columns per row with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN on desktop THEN the system SHALL show all columns horizontally with dynamic widths
4. WHEN touch interactions are detected THEN the system SHALL optimize drag and drop for touch devices
5. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kanban board user, I want visual feedback when interacting with columns, so that I understand what actions are available and their current state.

2. WHEN a column is being edited THEN the system SHALL highlight the active edit state
3. WHEN a column is empty THEN the system SHALL show a subtle message encouraging card creation
4. WHEN drag and drop is available THEN the system SHALL show appropriate visual cues
5. WHEN actions are loading THEN the system SHALL display loading states to prevent confusion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Kanban board user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common column operations, so that I can work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses 'n' THEN the system SHALL open the new column modal
2. WHEN a user presses 'e' while a column is focused THEN the system SHALL enter edit mode for that column
3. WHEN a user presses Delete while a column is focused THEN the system SHALL prompt for column deletion
4. WHEN a user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL cancel any active column operation
5. IF the user lacks appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL ignore restricted keyboard shortcuts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Kanban board user, I want columns to show summary information, so that I can quickly understand the workload and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a column THEN the system SHALL display the total number of cards
2. WHEN WIP limits are set THEN the system SHALL show current count vs limit with visual indicators
3. WHEN cards have priorities THEN the system SHALL show a breakdown of priority distribution
